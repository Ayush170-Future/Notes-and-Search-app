## ðŸš€ About Me
Hey! This is Ayush Singh. I'm a backend developer and a Bitcoin core contributor from India. 

Most recently, I was chosen among 45 students from all over the world for the Summer of Bitcoin internship, where I was responsible for making open-source contributions to Bitcoin Core. I made 4 PRs to the original Bitcoin you must have heard about in the news, one of them is already merged and is in production. Along with that, I'm a backend developer who has worked on many full-stack applications related to Blockchain and Core CS technologies. I'm also a great problem solver as I do a lot of competitive programming, I'm a Specialist on Codeforces, an ICPC India regionalist, and a Knight on Leetcode.

Besides my technical knowledge and experience, I'm very interested in philosophy and I'm a self-driven person, I don't need external motivation to work hard, I'm a naturally hardworking being, who gets things done.
